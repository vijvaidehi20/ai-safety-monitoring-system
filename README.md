# 🚨 AI Safety Monitoring System

An AI-powered surveillance system that combines **Computer Vision + RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) + LangGraph agents** to detect suspicious activity in real time and trigger alerts.

The system monitors a camera feed, detects incidents such as **falls or suspicious gestures**, evaluates risk using **AI reasoning over safety protocols**, and sends alerts with captured evidence.

## 🚀 Running the Project

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2️⃣ Start the monitoring system
python app/main.py

### 3️⃣ Run the dashboard
streamlit run app/dashboard/streamlit_app.py

---

## 📊 Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard displays:

- system statistics  
- latest detected incident  
- incident history  
- incident image gallery  

---

## 📁 Incident Logging

Every detected event is stored in:
logs/incidents.json

Example record:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "INC_20260307_004605",
  "camera_id": "camera_1",
  "people_count": 2,
  "risk_level": "HIGH",
  "image_path": "incidents/incident_20260307_004605.jpg",
  "alert_sent": true
}
```
